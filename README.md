- API Key from Groq for `ChatGroq` integration

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codebytemirza/MY-CLIENT-BOT-AI-MAIL-SENDER.git
   cd MY-CLIENT-BOT-AI-MAIL-SENDER
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the Required Packages**

   Install all the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   You need to create a `.env` file for your API key and email credentials. In the project root directory, create a `.env` file:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

   Add the following content to `.env`:

   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password
   EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_gmail_address@gmail.com
   ```

   - Replace `your_app_specific_password` with your Gmail app-specific password.
   - Replace `your_gmail_address@gmail.com` with your Gmail address.

5. **Run the Application**

   Start the Streamlit app by running:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will open a browser window with the Streamlit interface.

## Environment Variables

This project requires the following environment variables to function:

- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your Groq API key for using `ChatGroq` to generate personalized email content.
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your Gmail app-specific password to send emails.
- `EMAIL_ADDRESS`: Your Gmail address for sending emails.

The `.env` file should look like this:

```plaintext
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_gmail_address
```

## Usage

1. **Upload CSV File**: The app requires a CSV file as input. The CSV file should contain the following columns:

   - `Name`: The name of the client.
   - `Email`: The email address of the client.
   - `Service`: The service you are offering to the client.

2. **Generate Emails**: Once the CSV is uploaded, click the **Send Emails** button to generate and send personalized emails to each client.

3. **Success and Error Messages**: You will get real-time feedback if the email was sent successfully or if there was an error.

## Sample CSV Format

Your CSV file should be in the following format:

```csv
Name,Email,Service
Ecommerce by Experts,ecommercebyexperts@gmail.com,E-commerce
Seordev Digital Marketing Agency,seordev@gmail.com,Digital Marketing
Ubuntu Education Consultancy,ubuntueducation@gmail.com,Education Consultancy
